# Decentralized Multi-Objective Contract Augmentation Learning

This repository contains the code for our project on "Decentralized Multi-Objective Contract Augmentation Learning: An Integration of Solidity Smart Contracts and Auto AI Agents in Partially Observable Stochastic Games". 

## Project Description

Our project explores the application of Solidity smart contracts and Auto AI agents in the context of Multi-Objective Contract Augmentation Learning (MOCA). We propose a novel approach to align the incentives of multiple agents towards socially optimal outcomes in a decentralized environment. The methodology involves the use of Solidity smart contracts to define the rules of interaction and reward distribution among agents, and Auto AI agents to adapt to these rules over time in the context of partially observable stochastic games (POSGs).

## Repository Structure

- `contracts/`: This directory contains the Solidity smart contracts used in our project.
- `agents/`: This directory contains the code for the Auto AI agents.
